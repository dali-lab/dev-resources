# DALI's Google Apps Script
Author: Pat Xu

At the start of each term we onboard anywhere from a few to a few dozen people. I wrote a Google Apps Script to help speed up this process. Read on to learn how to use the Script.

Developers, go [here](./googlescript-dev.md).

We use [this](https://docs.google.com/a/dali.dartmouth.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMvbnWtDLdKTxKyPDRRnpkc29yn_YbY8iYDqibNuVxzwfJZA/viewform) Google Form to get new member information. The script uses the information from this form to
1. create an email for the user, and
2. add the user to the upcoming term's Google group

I'll explain in a bit more detail here.

## Creating Emails
- [this script](https://docs.google.com/a/dali.dartmouth.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMvbnWtDLdKTxKyPDRRnpkc29yn_YbY8iYDqibNuVxzwfJZA/viewform) pulls responses from the DALI Personnel Details form and does a few things:
  1. parses for their first and last name
  1. makes a new email `[first].[last]@dali.dartmouth.edu`
  1. creates an email with password "welcometodali"
  1. adds the email to a group called `[term]@dali.dartmouth.edu`
- note:
  - the script runs automatically on form submission

## Adding to the Termly Google Group
- the script will also add the newly created email to the termly Google group via the following method
  - anywhere from week 3 of 17W to week 3 of 17S, someone filling out this form will be added to the 17S@dali.dartmouth.edu group. this obviously extends to later terms
- note:
  - the script pulls the current term from the [DALI Lab Hours](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1thFB3xyX5wVN9gdz_K0pk3fUjwLxXIWyJ_rlK7A4TYg/edit#gid=188556850) spreadsheet. make sure this is updated!

## Zapier: Github and Welcome Email
Zapier is also in on the action. It'll take a form submission and
1. invite that user to the DALI Github org, and
1. send the user a welcome email with their email, password, and instructions to set up Slack with their new DALI email
